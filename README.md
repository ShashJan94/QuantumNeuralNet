# Simple Quantum Neural Network (QNN) with Qiskit and Classical MLP

This repository contains a simple implementation of a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) using Qiskit and a Classical Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for comparison. The QNN is built using quantum circuits to process input data, and the results are compared with a classical neural network.

## Overview

The project demonstrates the following:
- Building and training a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) using Qiskit.
- Building and training a Classical Neural Network (MLP) using Scikit-learn.
- Comparing the performance of QNN and MLP on the Iris dataset.
- Visualizing the measurement results of the QNN using Qiskit histogram plots.
- Displaying confusion matrices and accuracy comparison plots for both models.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install qiskit matplotlib scikit-learn
